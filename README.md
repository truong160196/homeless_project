## Introduce
Reasons for homelessness include shortages of affordable housing, privatization of civic services, investment speculation in housing, unplanned and rapid urbanization, as well as poverty, unemployment, and family breakdown.

- Every person needs food, water, personal commodities, clothes for daily survival. It will be unimaginable awful if those necessities are provided only once per week.  Provision of such necessities should instead take place everyday until they can reach a better condition.
- The distribution takes place under the risk of violence and insecurity.  The homeless have to wait in queues and some jump the queues struggling for the food. 
- Why not let them use the donated money to directly make the purchase themselves?
